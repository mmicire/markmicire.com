                <div class="fold-main"><p>Operated as a self-managed technician for local businesses, providing secure network architecture design, structured cabling installation, and ongoing network management. Worked directly with customers on server maintenance and computer repairs, and conducted penetration testing (both intrusive and non-intrusive) for security audits. Performed post-incident forensic analysis of compromised servers to support recovery and resilience planning. This entrepreneurial role offered early experience in customer-facing technical services and built a solid foundation in cybersecurity and IT operations.</p></div>

          <div class="desc"><p>Served as a robot operator on the rubble piles at Ground Zero for eleven days following the collapse of the Twin Towers. Worked in direct support of FEMA and the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) as part of the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR).  Deployed advanced robotic systems to provide remote reconnaissance in unstable void spaces, extending the reach of human responders and reducing risk in areas deemed unsafe for entry. Conducted reconnaissance, inspection, and data collection tasks that informed real-time decision-making for incident command and emergency crews.  This deployment marked the first recorded use of robots in a major urban search and rescue operation, establishing robotics as a credible tool for disaster response worldwide. The experience forged lasting connections with first responder communities and set the foundation for a career-long commitment to applying robotics in the service of public safety and resilience.</p></div>
